## Who are we? 
Dr Tessio Novack, Dr James Tripp and Dr Carlos Camara Menoyo. We are researchers from the 
[University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk). 
 
## What are our interests? 
This study examines ‘walkability’. Specifically, what makes an area seem more or less walkable? 
 
## What is in this questionnaire? 
We ask about demographic information, a short personality inventory, for ratings of images, 
information on your past experience and influences on your ratings. No personal data from you will 
be collected at any point, and we will not have any way to trace your answers to you
